# Sky Protocol Project Catalyst Milestone 2

## Abstract

This repository demonstrates the interplay between a bridge contract
that stores the root hash of a data availability merkle tree, and a
client contract that uses the root hash stored in the bridge to pay
out a bounty.

The root hash in the bridge is stored in an NFT UTXO and must be
signed by a committee of data availability providers.

## Acceptance criteria

Reference: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200203/milestones/2

### 1

[quote]
The deliverable is to demonstrate the basic infrastructure for
stateful interaction with and between two smart contracts, one for the
DA bridge, one for a DA client

The file link:src/SkyContracts.hs[] contains the bridge
(`bridgeTypedValidator`) and client (bounty) contracts
(`clientTypedValidator`).

### 2

[quote]
The smart contracts should build, and the tests shall pass

See setup and testing instructions, below.

### 3

[quote]
The tests shall actually have a private Cardano network
execute the on-chain smart contract flows of a Data Availability
interaction

The tests, below, execute on the Cardano Preview testnet.

### 4

[quote]
Since they must actually run on-chain, the smart contracts must be
written in a language that supports Cardano, whichever language we may
choose.

We use PlutusTx Haskell for the on-chain contracts, and the MeshJS
framework for the off-chain parts.

## Contracts

## Simplifying assumptions

* Per non-criteria 1: Instead of a committee multisig, only a single
  public key is used.  This will be extended to a real multisig for
  the next milestone.

* Per non-criteria 1: Instead of a full Merkle proof, this uses a
  reduced 1-level, 2-arm Merkle proof.  Only the left or right hash
  has to be supplied.  This will be extended for the next milestone.

# Testing the contracts

Requirements: Debian/Ubuntu Linux box.

## Setup

Setting up requires two automated and two manual steps:

### Step 1: Install dependencies and generate keys (link:pre-setup.sh[])

```
./pre-setup.sh
```

### Step 2: Manual configuration

#### Step 2.1: Configure Blockfrost provider

This requires a free Blockfrost API key from https://blockfrost.io/

Replace `YOUR_BLOCKFROST_API_KEY` and call the following command:

```
echo YOUR_BLOCKFROST_API_KEY > var/blockfrost.api-key
```

#### Step 2.2: Get funds from testnet faucet

Find the admin address:

```
cat var/admin.addr
```

Go to https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnets/tools/faucet/

Send funds to the admin address.

### Step 3: Finalize setup (link:post-setup.sh[])

```
./post-setup.sh
```

## Test 1: Updating the Bridge

This test demonstrates updating the bridge UTXO NFT with two different
merkle root hashes, and verifying (by querying the blockchain) that
the updates have indeed happened.

Check out the link:test-1.sh[] file for a more detailed description.

```
./test-1.sh
```

This uses the files:

* link:update-bridge.mjs[] to update the bridge NFT
* link:verify-bridge.mjs[] to verify the bridge NFT's current value

## Test 2: Offering and claiming a bounty

This test demonstrates offering a bounty that will be paid out if a
claimant can demonstrate that a particular datum is stored in the
merkle tree by providing a merkle proof.

Check out the link:test-2.sh[] file for a more detailed description.

```
./test-2.sh
```

This uses the files:

* link:offer-bounty.mjs[] to lock some funds at the bounty contract
* link:verify-bounty-offered.mjs[] to verify that some funds are locked at the contract
* link:claim-bounty.mjs[] to claim the bounty (i.e. unlock the locked funds)
* link:verify-bounty-claimed.mjs[] to verify that the locked funds have be claimed
