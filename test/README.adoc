# Sky Protocol Project Catalyst Milestone 2

Reference: https://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1200203/milestones/2

## Abstract

This repository demonstrates the interplay between a bridge contract
that stores the root hash of a data availability merkle tree, and a
client contract that uses the root hash stored in the bridge to pay
out a bounty.

The root hash in the bridge is stored in an NFT UTXO and must be
signed by a committee of data availability providers.

# Testing the contracts
